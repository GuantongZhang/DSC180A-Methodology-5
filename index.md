**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found it is interesting to extract information from spectrograms, which is a useful tool to visualize the sound. Sometimes, we can identify the birdsongs very easily by their unique patterns, and also distinguish different aircrafts by the frequency of their noises.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation is the correlation between the noise pollution and bird activities, which may be reflected in the effect of aircrafts on the frequency of birdsongs. Since our data contain both with and without consistent flyovers and the behavior of birds through bird songs in both situations, they are ideal for predicting how bird songs change in the presence of planes.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In this quarter, we originally supposed to label the audio files so that we can use them next quarter. However, given the technical difficulties we have encountered, we haven't been able to start labelling yet. Therefore, a potential change for the next quarter is that we will not manually label the data, but use some unsupervised learning instead.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in deep neural networks which could be used to classify birdsongs of different species and noises made by different types of aircrafts.
